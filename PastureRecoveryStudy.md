# Pasture Recovery Study

This is a study to measure the grazing recovery time for various plants within the pasture. Recovery time is defined as the number of days after grazing that a plant has fully recovered, which means it can safely be grazed again without suffering from overgrazing.

To measure the recovery time, a small section of ungrazed pasture with a representastive selection of plants is photographed and then mowed. After mowing it is photographed again on a weekly basis. When visual inpection reveals that the pasture is in a state similar to before mowing the recovery time is recorded.
