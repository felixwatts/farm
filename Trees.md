## Growing from Seed

### Germination

Some tree seeds will only germinate under certain conditions that mimic those found in nature. For example, some seeds are evolved to pass through the digestive tract of an animal before germinating, or to sit dormant through a cold winter before germinating in spring.

In order to simulate these conditions, some species seeds require _scarification_ and/or _stratification_ before they will germinate. To find which treatment is necessary for a given species use an internet search.

_Scarification_ is the process of breaking the water tight seal of the seed's outer layer so that moisture can begin to infiltrate. This can be done with a razor blade or with sandpaper. Always be careful not to completely puncture the seed's skin, the aim is only to break the waxy water tight outer layer. If the seeds are small and you are processing a lot of them you can attach a tin can to a cordless drill and line the inside with sandpaper, then process the seeds in batches.

_Stratification_ simulates the climatic conditions that would cause the seed to germinate in nature. There are two types of stratification, cold- and hot-. Hot stratification mimics the warm period that the seed would experience on the tree, or at the end of its first year. According to Richard Perkins, we can usually ignore this step and still get good germination.

To cold stratify, seeds must be held at about 5C in damp but not wet conditions for a certain period. This may take place in the dark. The seeds should not freeze. One method is to place the seeds in a zip-lock bag with a small amount of moss or slightly damp material. The bag can be labeled with the species and expected germination date and placed in the fridge. You should check the seeds regularly as they may germinate sooner than expected.

If both scarification and stratification are required then always scarify first.

### Potting Up

Once seeds have germinated they must be planted in a nursery pot where they will grow to a strength that they can be planted out. The best type of nursery pot to use is called a _root trainer_. This is a special type of pot that has two useful features: 

The pot has a tall thin shape and vertical grooves in the side encourage the roots to grow downwards which prevents the tree becoming root bound. Once a plant has become root bound in a pot it can never fully recover. When the roots reach the bottom of the pot the are _air pruned_ by contact with the air.

Root trainers can also be opened from a hinge at the bottom meaning tha the seedling can be removed easily from the pot without damaging the roots.

Seeds should be planted in a free draining potting compost incorporating so e slow release NPK fertilizer pellets.

The seedlings do not require full sun

## Buying

Always buy bare-root where possible. Some good suppliers can be found in [Resources](Resources.md)

## Planting

The care taken when planting a tree can have a dramatic effect on the vigor of the tree, especially in the first few years. When planting a tree there are three main considerations:

1. Decompact the rooting zone to enable rapid root development
1. Prevent competition with grass and other annuals
1. Establish a fungal dominated soil ecosystem

### Dig the Hole

Start by digging a hole for the tree. The hole should have two parts, a wide shallow dish to accommodate the surface roots, and a central deeper shaft to accommodate the tap-root. Here's a cross-section:

```
    <----1m----->
----\___    ___/---- ^
        \  /         |
         \/          |80cm
                     -

```

### Plant the Tree

Plant the tree into the hole using the same soil you removed, try not to mix the sub-soil and the top-soil. Do not apply any soil amendments, those will go on top later. Make sure that the tree meets the soil at the same level as it did within its pot, burying the trunk can cause the tree to rot and planting it too high could cause it to dry out.

### Apply a Fungal Mulch

Mulch the tree with about 80l of fungal compost spread over a 50cm radius. On top of the compost spread 5-10 cm of wood chip. Make sure to keep the mulch away from the tree trunk. These high-carbon materials will begin to promote a fungal based soil ecosystem which mimics the forest where the tree naturally grows.

### Protect the Tree from Animals

Use a spiral tree protector to prevent animals from eating the tree.

### Water Thoroughly

Water the tree very thoroughly. If all is well this is the only time you will ever need to water it.

###  Field Scale Plating Using a Ripper and Bed Former

A _Ripper_, _Subsoiler_ or _Keyline Plough_ is a rigid tined, non-inverting plough that can be used to decompact soil up to 80cm deep without exposing bare earth. A _Bed Former_ is another tractor implement that forms a tilled raised bed in one pass.

By first ripping with the Subsoiler and then passing with the bed former you can create a strip of deeply decompacted and surface decompacted soil suitable and easy to plant trees into on a large scale.

After planting you should mulch as above and also seed ground cover to fix the bare earth situation. 

## Maintenance

It is a good idea to reapply fungal compost and wood chip annually until the tree is well established enough to make significant leaf litter of its own
