# Ponds and dams

## DIY Permeability Test

Perhaps the most reliable DIY testing method for low-risk pond construction (ie, no large retaining banks) can be done with a 2L bottle;

1. Cut the bottom of a 2L soft drink bottle
1. Invert the bottle and compact in soil to be tested (about 1/3 full)
1. Remove the lid, fill the remainder of the bottle with water and sit in the bottom piece you cut off
1. If no water seeps through the soil within 24 hours then the soil has good water holding properties
Using a GCL liner

We dug inspection trenches on the proposed pond sites at the farm and quickly established that the subsoil was sand and rock; not ideal to hold water!

If there is any risk involved with designing of a pond structure, then using a liner is preferred.  We use 'Bentomat' a GCL product (geosynthetic clay liner) from www.fla.se which comes in at about Eur 5/m2 delivered.   Cheaper than high-quality plastic and a much better material all round.  We have also used UK companies (http://bit.ly/2zqxW3B) where you can find answers to questions about the material (http://bit.ly/2B0sYqA)

This material is very easy to work with and is supplied with bentonite powder for creating seams between different pieces of liner.  These simply overlap 30-40cm with a continuous bead of bentonite between them.  Once covered with topsoil and moistened, the bentonite swells to 8 times its original thickness and becomes watertight.  What's more, if you puncture the material it is self- sealing.  In this manner, overflow pipes can be easily installed straight through the liner, etc.

Lining a pond or dam reduces risk substantially, and an additional benefit of this material is that the topsoil put back on top of the liner can be immediately planted.  Not only does this stabilize embankments, but allows the earth-working to heal very quickly.  

## Constructing Outlets

GCL certainly makes the process of installing a pipe through the wall of the pond incredibly easy, due to the self-sealing property of bentonite.  An X cut is made through which the pipe is placed.  An additional collar is cut (in the example below a 1x1m square, with a good amount of bentonite powder joining the pieces and surrounding the pipe.

Whenever you lead water to a water body you must plan overflows capable of handling the largest possible downpours/ storms, etc.  With small ponds filled from a roof, stream or spring, it is simplest to make the outflow pipe considerably larger than any inflow.  We have a 10cm pipe bringing stream water which renews the entire pond water in 48 hrs, with an outflow pipe of 30cm that can handle any rate of inflow without risk of the water level rising.  If the pond is receiving water from run-off in the surrounding catchment, then this needs to be factored into calculating adequate overflow.  Again, if you don't know what you are doing then seek professional advice.
