# Overview of Latest Thinking on Plans for Farm

## Market Gardening

I will use the "sections and beds" technique from Curtis Stone. This means sections of 6m x 15m containing 6 beds of 75cm and 5 paths of 30cm. I will start with one section.

## Accommodation

A-Frame cabin, fully glazed at front, no other glazing. The loca timber store (https://brookridgestore.com) does lengths up to 3m.  

## Water

## Livestock

## Trees

Around the outer edges of the field, install hedgerows roughly along contour lines at roughly 18m spacing, encircling the field. The hedgerows will be hazel with occasional sweet chestnut trees. 

The lanes between can be grazed by ruminants (cows or geese?) followed by chickens, moving along the lane each day to avoid over-grazing.

The hazel can be layed to hedge using traditional method and will provide hazel nuts or at least attract grey squirrel that can be trapped and used to grow maggots for chicken feed.

The sweet chestnut will be spaced to provide about 30% ground cover when full grown so as not to reduce grass growth.
