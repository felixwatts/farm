# Overview of Latest Thinking on Plans for Farm

## Phase Zero (2020)

- No planning requirements
- Get started in 2020
- Start very small

Phase Zero is a plan to get a foothold on the land and get started growing and camping on the land ASAP. The main infrastructure developments include:

- Track 0 (to field)
- Shepherds hut
- Small greenhouse sized polytunnel
- Garden Shed (no foundations)
- Formation of 5x10m beds
- Compost Toilet
- Water butt
- Gardening materials and tools
- Large scale tree planting

## Market Gardening

I will use the "sections and beds" technique from Curtis Stone. This means sections of 6m x 15m containing 6 beds of 75cm and 5 paths of 30cm. I will start with one section.

## Accommodation

Initially: a tiny cabin, could be from Brookridge Timber,

Later: A self-built home constructed on the mezzanine level of a barn

## Water

## Livestock

## Pasture

The second layer of the grand plan is dedicated to pasture totalling about four acres. This is to be managed for production of meat, to increase biodiversity and soil health and to sequester carbon.

Mob-grazing of ruminants (probably sheep and/or geese) will be used to control grass growth and increase soil health.

An element of silvopasture may be included by planting rows of trees within the pasture at a spacing so as to cause no more than 30% canopy cover. For example, nitrogen fixing trees such as Italian Alder may be used to increase pasture productivity, create a wind break and provide a further harvest of timber.

The outer layer of the grand plan is a roughly 20 strip dedicated to productive woodland. The primary makeup being hazel coppice stools at 2.5m spacing interspersed with standards of oak, sweet chestnut, beech, hornbeam. This is designed to produce privacy, habitat, firewood, mast and timber as well as potentially mushrooms and ginseng.
