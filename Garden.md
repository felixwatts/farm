# Garden

One thing I want to develop is a beautiful garden. This would provide several benefits

- An outdoor area that is beautiful and comfortable to inhabit and socialize in
- A microclimate for warmth loving plants
- An area for experimenting with Peraculture
- An place for ornamental and non-native plants
- A haven for wildlife
- Unusual perrennial crops

## Design Considerations

- A warm, sheltered microclimate is essential
- Sunlight should be maximised
- A water feature is beautiful and good for wildlife
- It would be lovely to have the opportunity to swim
- A level, firm, clear area will improve the comfort for inhabiting with groups

## Location

There are two areas of the site that are not already accounted for, `E5` which is directly north of the veg garden and the area `A3-C8`, against he north boundary. Of these two, the latter presents the greater opporunity for creating shelter, therefore that seems the most suitable to me.

## Design

I heard about a permaculture design that seems to meet a lot of the requirements here. I'll call it the Pond and Horseshoe. A large pond is created, and directly North of that, the spoil is used to create a horseshoe shaped embankment. This acts in several ways to create a warm, sheltered, sunny space within the horseshoe, namely:

- The embankment acts as a wind break
- The pond reflects sunlight into the horseshoe
- The large water body acts to regulate heat within the area
- The thermal mass of the embankment releases heat overnight and in cold periods

## Scale

My initial estimates are:

- Pond roughly 10m wide, 15m long and 2.5m deep at the deepest point. This is large enough to provide swimming possibilities and fits the recommended minimum depth recommend for a natural swimming pond. This volume will also provide enough spoil for the embankment.
- Horseshoe embankment, inner radius 10m, outer radius 12.5m, max height 2m. This should provide enough windbreak and create a semi-enclosed but light feeling
- The centre of the horseshoe to be located about 30m roughly North of the centre of the pond.
- The pond to be oriented North-South
