# Project Swimming Pond

## Status

Underway

## Goal

To establish a natural swimming pond and to use the spoil to create a horseshoe embankment for the Garden project

## Overview

By digging a natural swimming pond and using the spoil to create a South-facing horseshoe shaped embankment I can achieve several things:

- A place for swimming
- A habitat for water species of plants and animals
- A sunny sheltered place for the Garden project

    - [x] Sketchup model
    - [x] Spreadheet: Farm - Horseshoe
- [ ] Test trench
- [ ] Detailed plans for overspill
- [ ] Detailed plans for planting area separation
- [ ] Dig

    - Says it's feasible
    - Rough price 10K dug and lined and embankment built
    - SHould be fine to let it fill slowly with rain
- 21/11/2020 Completed detailed volume and shape model on sketchup and spreadsheet
