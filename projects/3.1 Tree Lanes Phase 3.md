## Black board

- Species selection thoughts
    - Sweet chestnut
        - doesn't seem to do well on the site - needs further monitoring of South Wood Phase 1
    - Would an evergreen selection be good for winter wind mitigation?
        - Options?
    - Hazel
        - Grow well
        - Fodder
        - Fence making?
        - Garden poles?
        - Coppice for wind mitigation
        - Will encourage squirrels
    - Walnut
        - Seems to grow well
        - Doesn't seem to need deer protection?
        - Produces more oil per hectare than Rape
        - Will encourage squirrels
        - Timber
