# Project HQ Phase 1

Pending

## Goal

To establish the following facilities:

- A sheltered and covered space with
    - A kitchen work surface
    - A large storage shelf
    - A sink with running cold water
    - A dining table with chairs
    - A rocket stove
    - A ground level sleeping platform with mattress
    - A space to be later filled by a cabin


## Overview

Using scaffolding already on site I will cosntruct a cuboid frame of 6m x 6m x 3m high. I will stretch the large tarpauling already on site over the top, leaving one side unattached to the frame which will hopefully mean it sheds water to that side. I will stretch appropraitely sized tarpaulins over three of the four walls creating a sheltered and quite dry internal space.

Along one whole side, a kitchen work surface will be constructed from plywood supported on more scaffolding. The kitchen will be fitted with
a sink and a rocket stove made of four hollow concrete blocks.

The middle of the room will be occupied by a dining table and chairs.

In a back corner I will make a simple wooden deck to raise a single mattress off the ground.

The building will be oriented with the grid, with its North West corner at P74. The open wall will be to the North.
