# Project HQ Phase 1

## Status

Pending

## Goal

To establish the following facilities:

- A sheltered and covered space with
    - A kitchen work surface
    - A large storage shelf
    - A sink with running cold water
    - A dining table with chairs
    - A rocket stove

## Overview

Using scaffolding already on site I will construct a cuboid frame of 6m x 3m x 3m high. I will cover three walls and the roof with tarpaulins.

Along one whole side, a kitchen work surface will be constructed from plywood supported on more scaffolding. The kitchen will be fitted with
a sink and a rocket stove made of four hollow concrete blocks.

The middle of the room will be occupied by a dining table and chairs.

The building will be oriented with the grid, with its North West corner at P74. The open wall will be to the North.

## Log

- 05/08/2021: Had the idea in a brainwave!
- ? Built structure and put of roof
    - Didn't make roof drainage holes yet
    - Huge rainstorm over night
    - Roof canvas full of probably a tonne of water
    - Canvas stretched
    - Frame bent!
    - Structure taken down
- ? Location moved to south west corner
    - Higher altitude for water collection
    - Lovely view
- ? Reconstructed
    - Size halved to 3x6x3
    - Roof configuration changed to not need drainage holes
- ? Decided to add a floor
- ? Bought a petrol generator so I can build stuff on site!
- ? Structure blown off of support blocks! Reassembled
- ? Started fitting floor, found out base is not square
    - Reassembled square
    - Also decided to change roof configuration again
    - New configuration remains untested
