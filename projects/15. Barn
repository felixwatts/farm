# Project Barn

## Status

Underway

## Goal

To establish several facilities within a building on the site, including:

- Hay storage
- A tool store
- A workshop
- Livestock winter housing

## Overview

- [ ] Finalize siting and design
- [ ] Get planning permission
- [ ] Order and pay
- [ ] Build

## Map

## Log

- 20/05/2022 met with Tiddles for initial discussion on design and feasibility

## Black board

[Sketchup drawing](./sketchup/Barn 2022 1.0.skp)

Latest thinking:

- Steel building on concrete footings
- 45' long by 24' wide by 20' high
- Three bays of 15' wide
- Two floors each 10' high
- Clad in yorkshire board
- Downstairs bays:
    - workshop (concrete floor, concrete panel wall base, full cladding)
    - equipment store (hardcore floor, cladding on windward side, open at front to hard standing)
    - livestock winter housing (hardcode floor, cladding on windward side, open at front to pasture)
- Upstairs bays
    - Hay storage
    - Hay storage
    - Possible future cabin

## Planning Application

Objections in initial Application

- AONB objected to 'Sporadic' development due to widely distributed nature of works
    - We have consolidated all works into one small site adjacent to the access route. The site sits between two other similarly developed sites.
- AONB seeks to limit proliferation of buildings on small sites
    - Beauty is subjective but I would argue that a landscape made of lots of small farms and smallholdings is more beautiful and likely more biodiverse than one made of a few large farms. A patchwork of small farms also has the potential to provide both more employment and more food than the status quo. 
- Archeology could be damaged
    - We have carried out an archaeological survey of the site
- Ecology & wildlife officer suggested provision of bird boxes, bat boxes and that artificial lighting be in accordance with BCT guidance on bats and artificial lighting
    - We have met all of these requests
    - There will be no external or externally visible artificial lighting
- Parish council opposed the application due to it being 'sporadic'
    - Again, the development has been concentrated into one small site, which sits between two other similarly developed sites.
- Public rights of way team raised concerns that works on the site might block public footpath 25a, Hemyock
    - We do not forsee any effects on that footpath of this development or associated works 
- The main objection seems to be that the developments weren't shown to be necessary to support farming activity.
    - This development is not necessary for the running of an industrial farming business but it is necessary to enable a long-term land stewardship project which will have significant benefits for the local area in terms of biodiversity, carbon sequestration, food localisation and education. Some of the activities that this development will enable include:
        - Small scale beef and/or lamb production to supply the local market using minimal input, regenerative methods that promote species rich pasture and sequester carbon
        - Small scale market gardening to supply the local market using organic, no-till methods and locally sourced inputs
        - Small scale cider and apple juice production to supply the local market
        - All of this to be carried out without subsidy 
        - All of this to be carried out without the use of any artificial fertilisers, fungicides or herbicides
- There were some questions as to how I will be able to keep livestock under surveillance as I don't live at the site
    - I will be staying in a caravan on the site
    - Between my partner and myself, someone responsible will always be present on the site as long as livestock are there.

- Side note: The refusal document states that there was 'attempted negotiation' that the council has 'worked with the applicant and has looked for solutions to enable the grant of planning permission'. To my knowledge this is false. After the application they raised some questions and then within days (while I was still preparing my response) the rejection was published.
