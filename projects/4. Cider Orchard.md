# Project Cider Orchard

## Status

Underway

## Goal

To establish an orchard of cider apple trees along the Western boundary of the site

## Overview

I want to achieve

- Greater privacy
- A harvest
- A windbreak
- Allow for future access between my property and the property to the West

## Map

## Detail

Planting pattern:

- 2 rows parallel to boundary fence, staggered
- Fence - 4.5m - Tree - 4.5m - Tree - 1m
- Spacing within rows: 5m
- Stagger offset: 2.5m

For the planting procedure and protection I will follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9TFX-5OZw).

For mulching I will use cardboard and grass clippings.
