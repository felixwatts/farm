# Project Greenhouse

## Status

Planning

## Goal

To establish a large, earth sheltered greenhouse to 

- grow heat loving crops, 
- extend the growing season, 
- grow citrus
- nice place to inhabit?
- shower?
- use up earth from digging pond

## Overview

When digging the pond I will create a lot of earth that needs to be put somewhere, secondly, I want more frost free and warm growing space, both to extend the growing season and to grow larger quantities of tomatoes, chilies, spices, citrus etc.

I think I can solve both these problems at once by using the earth to shelter 3 sides (north, east, west) of a greenhouse structure to create a large frost-free growing space. Perhaps this could also double as winter livestock housing and/or a living area or shower area.

## Detail

> Detailed design is on Sketchup as Sun Bunker

Overall interior space is 6m wide x 16m long x 2.5m high to eaves. Frame of 48.3mm diameter aluminium poles: https://www.themetalstore.co.uk/products/aluminium-tube-for-tube-clamp. joined with Q-clamp system.

Battons of 47x75mm treated timber: https://brookridgestore.com/product/treated-timber-47mm/ fixed to frame with Q-clamp 198 double lugged bracket

Clad with 10mm twinwall polycarbonate sheet

Top vents made of 12mm marine ply painted white, opened with Bayliss Autovent https://www.baylissautovents.co.uk/product/mk-7-triple-spring-autovent/

? Bottom openings, always open, covered with knitted windbreak mesh https://www.sure-green.com/knitted-windbreak-mesh.html#158=285 in one side to prevent through draught.

Air gaps between frame and cladding filled with polyetheline pipe lagging: https://www.bes.co.uk/pipe-lagging-insulation-foam-54mm-x-20mm-x-2m-23714/?ref=gs

## Blackboard

- Timber or aluminium frame?
    - Aluminium
        - Already designed
        - Can build myself with a little help
        - High carbon?
    - Timber
        - Looks nicer?
        - Can get help from blackdown buildings?
        - Low carbon?
- Do I need a concrete pad?
    - High carbon?
    - Engineer seems reluctant to do the retaining wall without
    - Harder to grow citrus trees in containers than soil?
- Drainage?
    - Why wont water from outside flood the floor
    - How will irrigation water exit the building?
    - Will earth embankment drain well?
- Membrane
    - Is a membrane needed between the wall and the earth?
