# Project Hot Shower

## Status

Design phase

## Goal

To provide a hot shower facility at the field.

## Overview

An initial feasibility study suggests it will be possible to provide a solar powered and rainwater fed hot shower facility at the field. This will most likely be housed within an extension to the cabin, which itself will occupy the unused front part of the trailer.

The facility should be capable of providing at least one hot shower per week in mid-winter.

The water will be heated just prior to use using an electric heating element powered from the cabin's existing AC power circuit. Heating the water for one shower will take about an hour and a half.

The water will be fed from the cabin's existing pressurised cold water system.

A microcontroller will be used to coordinate the various components in order to make the system easy to use.
 
## Key Design Goals

- 4 minute shower (~40l with a [water saving shower head](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lowenergie-Energy-caravan-savings-functions/dp/B00EBR3PVE/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=water%2Bsaving%2Bshower%2Bhead&qid=1676660628&sr=8-6&th=1))
- 40°C water temperature

## Key Facts and Figures

- Specific heat capacity of water: 4.186 J/g°C
- Typical insulation conductivity: 0.02 w/mK
- Surface area of a 50 litre tank: ~0.75 m²
- Heating element power: 1000w
- With 10cm of insulation on the tank, heat loss during heating is insignificant to both total energy used and time to reach target temperature.
