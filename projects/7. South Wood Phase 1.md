# Project South Wood Pahse 1

## Status

Underway

## Goal

To begin establishing a strip of mixed woodland along the South boundary

## Overview

The South Wood Phase 1 is a 10m x 100m strip of woodland to be planted along the South boundary for:

- Wildlife habitat
- Timber
- Fodder
- Beauty
- Wind break
