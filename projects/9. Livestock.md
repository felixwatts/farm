## Blackboard

Latest thinking:
- Borrowing livestock would be a great start. Needs
    - Temp electric fencing
    - Water distribution
    - Drinkers
- Very small beef cattle herd grazed along pasture lanes
- Kept to small paddock with mobile electric fencing
- Paddock moved daily or so
- Water brounht to paddock via pipes, gravity
- Cut hay and store with neighbor for winter feed?
- Pay for slaughter+butcher with beef
- Store meat in freezer in carport

- Beef Cattle
    - From sonia
        - risk of 'poaching' in wet weather they can cause long term damage to the soil
        - You will need some winter shelter for them - could be a polytunnel
    - Will need hay in the winter
- Sheep
    - They escape easily
    - Feet need regular inspecting
    - Need regular de-worming with stuff that is bad for soil life
- Geese
    - Eat mainly grass
    - Very hard to pluck
- Broiler Chickens
    - Chicks needs heated dry pens called brooders before they can go outside
- Laying Hens

- 21/11/2020 Emailed Haye Farm to ask if I can volunteer there. They do rotational grazing of beef, sheep and poultry nearby
