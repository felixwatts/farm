## Blackboard

Latest thinking:
- Useful information if I need to build a business model for planning permission, potential for ~Â£200K turnover in beef on 9 acres: https://johnkempf.com/yield-six-thousand-pounds-of-beef-per-acre/
- Borrowing livestock would be a great start. Needs
    - Temp electric fencing
    - Water distribution
    - Drinkers
- Very small beef cattle herd grazed along pasture lanes
- Kept to small paddock with mobile electric fencing
- Paddock moved daily or so
- Water brought to paddock via pipes, gravity
- Cut hay and tree hay and store in barn for winter feed?
- Pay for slaughter+butcher
- Store meat in freezer in carport. Not big enough.

- Beef Cattle
    - From sonia
        - risk of 'poaching' in wet weather they can cause long term damage to the soil
        - You will need some winter shelter for them - could be a polytunnel
    - Will need hay in the winter
- Sheep
    - They escape easily
    - Feet need regular inspecting
    - Need regular de-worming with stuff that is bad for soil life
- Geese
    - Eat mainly grass
    - Very hard to pluck
- Broiler Chickens
    - Chicks needs heated dry pens called brooders before they can go outside
- Laying Hens
