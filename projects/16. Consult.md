### Jim Waterson - Forester ?/10/2023

We toured the hedgerows and I asked about how best to mange them.

Jim's advice:

- The Farming in Protected Landscapes FIPL grant could be applicable
- Ash trees should be felled and replaced
- When replacing trees on top of the stone bank you can plant at the foot of the bank if easier.
- Consider adding a hedge on Sonia's side to protect the apples trees
- Where hedge is thick and consistent: Grow on for one more year and then lay
