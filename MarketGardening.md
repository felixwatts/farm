## No Dig Permanent Raised Beds

In this system, 75cm wide permanent beds are formed with 25cm paths in between. The beds are never dug or tilled, instead weeds are initially killed by a thick mulch of compost over winter and are subsequently suppressed by hand weeding, intensive spacings that out-compete weeds and subsequent additions of compost mulch.

The 75cm bed width is used for two reasons, first it is easy to straddle for comfortable working, secondly, there is a set of recently developed tools that are all designed to work with 75cm (30in) beds.

The length of the bed doesn't matter but all your beds should be the same length in order to standardize everything. For example, calculating seed, compost or amendment requirements, calculating expected yields and having the right sized bed covers available all become easier when all beds have the same dimensions. In order to use tools efficiently, its important that the beds are at least 10m long. I suggest 10m beds laid end to end without a path to form 20m or 30m long sections, but that are treated as several 10m beds.

### Forming a New Bed

To form a new bed from pasture use the following procedure:

1. After growth has ceased, measure out the bed and path
1. Cover the bed with [corrugated packing cardboard](Resources.md#cardboard-roll)
1. Cover the bed with a layer of [compost](Resources.md#compost) about 18-20cm thick
1. Add any amendments such as [rock dust](Resources.md#rock-dust) or [oyster shell](Resources.md#oyster-shell)
1. Fill the path with wood chip to the bed level or a few centimeters below
1. Cover the bed with [plastic mulch](Resources.md#plastic-mulch)

In spring you can prepare and plant the bed

### Preparing a Bed for Planting

To prepare a newly formed or newly harvested bed for the next planting, use the following procedure:

1. Using sequiturs remove any above ground hard woody material such as cabbage stalks
1. Remove any weeds using the [Colinear Hoe](Tools.md#colinear-hoe) or [Korean Hoe](Tools.md#korean-hoe)
1. [Broadfork](Tools.md#broadfork) the bed to decompact and aerate it
1. Optionally apply 10cm of compost
1. Apply any amendments such as [rock dust](Resources.md#rock-dust) or [oyster shell](Resources.md#oyster-shell)
1. Using the [75cm Rake](Tools.md#75cm-rake) rake the bed level
1. Using the [Bed roller](Tools.md#bed-roller) roll the bed to a smooth, firm surface

The bed is now ready for transplanting or direct seeding

## Planting

### Direct Seeding

### Transplanting

Transplanting refers to starting crops from seed under cover in trays and then planting them into the bed once the plant is established. Richard Perkins recommends transplanting wherever you can for several reasons:

- Can start crops earlier
- Less pest pressure on the vulnerable seedlings prior to planting out
- Transplants are better able to outcompete weeds on a newly prepared bed, so reducing weed pressure
- Allows more efficient use of bed space, since there is less bare earth

However you should consider...

- Transplanting is more labour intensive and slower than direct seeding
- You need indoor/covered space for the seedlings
- You need trays
- You needs lots of potting compost every year
- The transplanting process inevitably slightly damages roots and temporarily stunts growth

The [Paper Pot Transplanter](Tools.md#paper-pot-transplanter) is a tool to massively speed up the seeding and transplanting process
