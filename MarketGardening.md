## No Dig Permanent Raised Beds

In this system, 75cm wide permanent beds are formed with 25cm paths in between. The beds are never dug or tilled, instead weeds are initially killed by a thick mulch of compost over winter and are subsequently suppressed by hand weeding, intensive spacings that out-compete weeds and subsequent additions of compost mulch.

The 75cm bed width is used for two reasons, first it is easy to straddle for comfortable working, secondly, there is a set of recently developed tools that are all designed to work with 75cm (30in) beds.

The length of the bed doesn't matter but all your beds should be the same length in order to standardize everything. For example, calculating seed, compost or amendment requirements, calculating expected yields and having the right sized bed covers available all become easier when all beds have the same dimensions. In order to use tools efficiently, its important that the beds are at least 10m long. I suggest 10m beds laid end to end without a path to form 20m or 30m long sections, but that are treated as several 10m beds.

### Forming a New Bed

To form a new bed from pasture use the following procedure:

1. After growth has ceased, measure out the bed and path
1. Cover the bed with [corrugated cardboard](#corrugated-cardboard-roll)
1. Cover the bed with a layer of [compost](#compost) about 18-20cm thick
1. Add any amendments such as [rock dust](#rock-dust) or [oyster shell](#oyster-shell)
1. Fill the path with wood chip to the bed level or a few centimeters below
1. Cover the bed with [plastic mulch](#plastic-mulch)

In spring you can prepare and plant the bed

### Preparing a Bed for Planting

To prepare a newly formed or newly harvested bed for the next planting, use the following procedure:

1. Using sequiturs remove any above ground hard woody material such as cabbage stalks
1. Remove any weeds using the [Colinear Hoe](Tools.md#colinear-hoe) or [Korean Hoe](Tools.md#korean-hoe)
1. [Broadfork](Tools.md#broadfork) the bed to decompact and aerate it
1. Optionally apply 10cm of compost
1. Apply any amendments such as [rock dust](#rock-dust) or [oyster shell](#oyster-shell)
1. Using the [75cm Rake](Tools.md#75cm-rake) rake the bed level
1. Using the [Bed roller](Tools.md#bed-roller) roll the bed to a smooth, firm surface

The bed is now ready for transplanting or direct seeding

### Preparing a Bed for Winter

Any beds that are to be left empty over winter should be prepared in the following way:

1. Using sequiturs remove any above ground hard woody material such as cabbage stalks
1. Remove any weeds using the [Colinear Hoe](Tools.md#colinear-hoe) or [Korean Hoe](Tools.md#korean-hoe)
1. [Broadfork](Tools.md#broadfork) the bed to decompact and aerate it
1. Optionally apply 10cm of compost
1. Apply any amendments such as [rock dust](#rock-dust) or [oyster shell](#oyster-shell)
1. Using the [75cm Rake](Tools.md#75cm-rake) rake the bed level
1. Cover the bed with [Plastic Mulch](#plastic-mulch)

### Direct Seeding

Direct seeding refers to planting seeds directly into a bed. It is the simplest form of planting and with today's tools is very efficient. To direct seed a newly prepared bed use the following procedure:

1. Determine the row spacing and plant spacing you intend to use (see [Crop Specifics](#crop-specifics))
1. Set up the [Six Row Seeder](#Tools.md#six-row-seeder) accordingly
1. Determine how much seed (by weight) is required for the whole bed
1. Using a milligram scales, weigh out the correct amount of seed
1. Divide the seed into the hoppers of the seeder, using hoppers according to your determined row spacing
1. Use the seeder to seed the bed, it will take two passes, since the seeder covers half a bed at a time
1. Optionally cover the bed with a layer of [Horticultural Fleece](#horticultural-fleece) laid directly on the ground. This will slightly increase the temperature and humidity and may improve germination

### Transplanting

Transplanting refers to starting crops from seed under cover in trays and then planting them into the bed once the plant is established. Richard Perkins recommends transplanting wherever you can for several reasons:

- Can start crops earlier
- Less pest pressure on the vulnerable seedlings prior to planting out
- Transplants are better able to outcompete weeds on a newly prepared bed, so reducing weed pressure
- Allows more efficient use of bed space, since there is less bare earth

However you should consider...

- Transplanting is more labour intensive and slower than direct seeding
- You need indoor/covered space for the seedlings
- You need trays
- You needs lots of potting compost every year
- The transplanting process inevitably slightly damages roots and temporarily stunts growth

#### Planting Out

The [Paper Pot Transplanter](Tools.md#paper-pot-transplanter) is a tool to massively speed up the seeding and transplanting process, however [the jury is still out](https://www.lowimpact.org/could-the-paperpot-transplanter-be-a-boon-for-small-farmers-or-is-it-just-a-gimmick/) on whether it's worth it

### Slugs

The best way to avoid slugs and snails is to avoid creating the right conditions for them in the garden. Slugs and snails feed mainly on rotting vegetable matter, so reduce that using the following policies:

- Never make compost near the crops
- Never apply unrotted compost material to the beds
- Regularly remove dead, damaged and fallen leaves from the crops/beds

## Row Covers

Row covers refer to making a tiny, one bed "polytunnel" of wire hoops covered in either [Horticultural Fleece](#horticultural-fleece) or [Insect Netting](#insect-netting).

A row cover of [Horticultural Fleece](#horticultural-fleece) increases the internal temperature which can extend the growing period for many crops, however it also increases internal humidity which may lead to fungal infections

A row cover of [Insect Netting](#insect-netting) is used to keep insect pests off the crop. This is especially important for brassicas which suffer from [cabbage white caterpillar](#cabbage-white-caterpillar), and other crops TODO that suffer from [Flea Beetle](#flea-beetle). It does not effect the internal climate.

The structure of the row cover is formed of 1.5m lengths of [4mm Galvanised Fencing Wire](#4mm-galvanized-fencing-wire), which keep their curved shape from the roll the come in. The semi circular sections are simple inserted about 15cm into the ground at 1m intervals

The covering for a 10m bed should be cut to 1.5m x 11m. Once the structure is up, the covering is laid over it and pinned down using [Horticultural Staples](#horticultural-staples)
