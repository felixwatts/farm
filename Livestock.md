# Livestock

Livestock seem like a good idea at some point. They have the potential to make use lots of abundant resources such as grass and space, build topsoil, produce fertilizer and of course produce food.

However, each type of livestock has its own challenges and issues. Many types would seem to require quite a lot of external input in the form of feed. Some need winter housing. 

My aim is to design a livestock enterprise that makes use of my abundant pasture, requires minimal external inputs, minimal infrastructure, builds topsoil, produces fertility and is easy to run. Making money is only a secondary objective.

The rest of this document assesses each type of livestock against these criteria

## Mob Grazing

Whatever livestock enterprise I do will probably use the *mob grazing* model. In this model the flock of livestock is reared mostly or solely on pasture. Temporary electric fencing is used to corral the flock into a small area and this area is moved every day. In this way the flock heavily impacts and fertilizes the pasture one small area at a time. Each area of pasture is impacted heavily and then given enough time to fully recover before being grazed again. This model has been demonstrated to be very effective at improving pasture and sequestering carbon.

## Broiler Chickens

**Summary**: Good profitability, quite good use of pasture and topsoil building. Need to crack the feed source for this to be acceptable.

Potential feeds that can be produced on the farm:

- Hemp seed
- Grubs from a compost heap/wood chip pile
- Maggots grown on roadkill/abattoir waste
- Soldier fly larvae from food waste

Pros:

- Easy to sell and fetch a good price
- Can be a summer only enterprise

Cons:

- Need a lot of high protein feed, traditionally soy, maize and wheat with fish meal and other protein substitutes.
- Need heated housing in winter
- Killing lots of chickens

## Laying Chickens

**Summary**: Medium profitability, very good topsoil building, need a high protein diet

## Geese

Pros:

- Can live outdoors all year
- Make very good use of grass
- Dont kill grass

Cons:

- Harder to sell than chicken?
- Noisy
- Can be aggressive

## Beef Cattle

**Summary**: Very good topsoil building. Can be combined effectively with laying hens which follow after ten days and feed on the grubs in the cowpats as well as spreading the pats. Good sale price and easy to sell. Relatively easy year round maintenance. Less killing per serving of meat. Probably needs hay production.

Pros:

- Can live outdoors all year
- Eat comfrey if wilted first
- Eat hazel branches

Cons:

- Need dietary supplement in winter - usually hay

## Milk Cattle

**Summary** I dont want to milk cows or take calves away from their mothers so regularly

## Rabbits

Pros:

- Love comfrey
- Make good use of grass
- Don't kill grass
- Relatively easy to breed your own stock

Cons:

- Need an indoor breeding setup
- Breeders need dietary supplement
- Hard to sell?

## Goats

## Sheep

Pros:

- Live outdoors all year
- Can live on grass all year ?

Cons:

- Not commercially viable
- They get sick a lot ?

## Pigs

Pros

- Eat everything including comfrey, hazel (leaves, twigs and nuts), used malt from breweries, sweet chestnut, walnut 
- Pork is delicious
- Hardy breeds can live outdoors all year
- Can live in woods/coppice so not use pasture space

Cons

- They eat a LOT and will most likely need externally produced feed
- Promote trees to grow in pasture
- Hard to herd
- How do digging pigs and no-till philosophy work together?
