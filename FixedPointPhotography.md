# Fixed Point Photography

This is to be a record of farm development over a period of years in the form of a set of photo series, each taken from a fixed location and orientation on the farm with annual or semi-annual photos.

## Coordinate System

Each photo is taken from a named location with the camera pointed in a named orientation. A code is given to each location and orientation combination, for example `P00S`, which means _from post 0,0 looking south_, or `P49SE` which means _from post 4,9 looking south east_.

The posts are laid out on a 20m grid. Post 0,0 is in the north west corner of the field. The x-axis runs along the west fence. Therefore, for example, the water collector is close to post 9,0 or `P90` and the north east gate is near to post post 2,8 or `P28`

The camera orientation is expressed using compass bearings `N`, `E`, `NE` for example. Note that this doesn't refer to true compass bearings but directions along the grid system axes. N-S is the x-axis and E-W is the y-axis. Camera orientation `D` means looking down at the ground.
