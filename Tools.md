## Broadfork

The core the the no-dig gardeners arsenal, the broadfork is a fork that can be used to efficiently decompact and aerate a 75cm bed without turning the soil over. The result is healthy soil life and a deep rooting zone for crops

## Bunyip or Water Level

This is a clever home-made tool for measuring the altitude difference between two points in a landscape. It can be useful for the following tasks:

- Creating a contour map (together with a GPS recorder such as a smartphone TODO is that accurate enough)
- Aligning a bed with the contour
- Leveling ground for building
- Understanding how water flows in a landscape
- Creating an overflow pipe that should fall on a 1/100 gradient

The tool consists of 

- two long wooden sticks (roughly 4cmx2cmx3m), each marked at 1cm intervals, numbered every 5cm
- A long, transparent water pipe, with one and attached to each stick so that the pipe runs the length of each stick, filled with (ideally food coloured) water up to about half way up the stick (when both held level on level surface)

The principle of the tool is, of course, that the altitude of the water surface is the same at each end of the pipe.

Using the tool requires two people and works like this:

1. Ensure the tool is sufficiently filled with water
1. Each person takes one stick, while moving place your thumb over the end of the tube to prevent water spills
1. Person A moves to the first location and holds the stick upright against the ground
1. Person B moves to the second location and holds their stick upright against the ground
1. Person B shouts out the number of the water level to Person A
1. The height difference is the difference between the readings at A and B
1. Therefore to find two places at the same level, person B moves up or downhill until the two measurements are the same
