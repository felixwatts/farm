# Water

Water is vitally important on a farm, for both crops and animals. Water should be moved by gravity from a high holding point, via pipes to where it is needed.

The reticulation system will have a permanent static component or A-pipe which carries water to the rough area where it is needed and provides connection points for temporary hoses or B-pipes that can be used to water specific areas as needed.

The A-pipe should be constructed of [HDPE piping](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/pipes-and-fittings/polyethylene-supply-pipe/high-density-polyethylene-hdpe-pipe.html). [T-junction fittings](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/catalog/product/view/id/44093/s/hydrosure-elite-tee-compression-with-male-thread-offtake-25mm-x-1-2-bsp/?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqs3rBRCdARIsADe1pfTf-HepkcHSCNIzRiJgtWfaUlll39A9wyO_ayufS3hN5IBcSde1QpYaAnUWEALw_wcB) can be used to create connection points. The connection points should use [quick release plumbing fittings](https://www.tubes-international.com/products/industrial-fittings/quick-release-water-couplings/) and marked with a brightly colored post. The B-pipes can be made of [gas piping](https://www.plasticdrainage.co.uk/yellow-gas-mdpe-pipe.html?pid=12636#1035=352&984=276&fo_c=1765&fo_k=b8400aa557286e86e8d7d83457c525b7&fo_s=gplauk&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqs3rBRCdARIsADe1pfQA1MYtNSfUnxUt0sOVN5WAhmYkWNBjWuek08XxF2edu-Xc0V8ExCoaAmTeEALw_wcB) and should be kept on reels near to where they are needed.

An animal waterer can be constructed from a PVC tub with [float valve](https://www.screwfix.com/c/heating-plumbing/float-valves/cat831620) and connected to the B-pipe using air hose fittings or quick release plumbing fittings
