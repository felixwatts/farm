# Water

Water is vitally important on a farm, for both crops and animals. Water should be moved by gravity from a high holding point, via pipes to where it is needed.

The reticulation system will have a permanent static component or A-pipe which carries water to the rough area where it is needed and provides connection points for temporary hoses or B-pipes that can be used to water specific areas as needed.

The A-pipe should be constructed of [HDPE piping](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/pipes-and-fittings/polyethylene-supply-pipe/high-density-polyethylene-hdpe-pipe.html). [T-junction fittings](https://www.waterirrigation.co.uk/catalog/product/view/id/44093/s/hydrosure-elite-tee-compression-with-male-thread-offtake-25mm-x-1-2-bsp/?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqs3rBRCdARIsADe1pfTf-HepkcHSCNIzRiJgtWfaUlll39A9wyO_ayufS3hN5IBcSde1QpYaAnUWEALw_wcB) can be used to create connection points. The connection points should use [quick release plumbing fittings](https://www.tubes-international.com/products/industrial-fittings/quick-release-water-couplings/) and marked with a brightly colored post. The B-pipes can be made of [gas piping](https://www.plasticdrainage.co.uk/yellow-gas-mdpe-pipe.html?pid=12636#1035=352&984=276&fo_c=1765&fo_k=b8400aa557286e86e8d7d83457c525b7&fo_s=gplauk&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqs3rBRCdARIsADe1pfQA1MYtNSfUnxUt0sOVN5WAhmYkWNBjWuek08XxF2edu-Xc0V8ExCoaAmTeEALw_wcB) and should be kept on reels near to where they are needed.

An animal waterer can be constructed from a PVC tub with [float valve](https://www.screwfix.com/c/heating-plumbing/float-valves/cat831620) and connected to the B-pipe using air hose fittings or quick release plumbing fittings

## Market Garden Irrigation

### Water Requirements

RP quotes 4cm of total irrigation per week

### Filter

Between the water source and the irrigation system you need a pump. RP recommends a _disc filter_ that is designed for dirty input water and to feed a drop irrigation system

### Irrigation and Row Coverings

Rain and spray irrigation can penetrate light fleece and insect netting, but you need to check with heavy fleece how well the water is penetrating


### Rain Gauge

Use a rain gauge in the garden to record how much rainfall there has been each week and decide whether to irrigate the next week or not. Empty yhe rain gauge after each week.

### Wind Break

Garden should be surrounded by 1m high wind break fence made of plastic wind break netting material or a hedge
